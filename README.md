## Facial Recognition. 

The script tracks my face from
frame to frame and puts a red box around it. I am currently
developing this program to include functionality to recognize a
human hand in the browser and allow it to interact with a website.
This program is being developed with OpenCV and PyScript.

## Reflection

This project has taught me a lot about utilizing python packages, HAAR Cascades for image detection,  XML files, and the possibilities of python in the browser on the front-end.

This project is built with Python and OpenCV.
